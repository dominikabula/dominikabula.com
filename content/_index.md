I'm a Scrum Master and PM Institute Certified #Agile Practitioner.  In addition to my work at Oracle NetSuite as an Agile Coach, I write and speak on a variety of topics, especially focused on my real-world experiences applying Agile Methodology.

Last Year I sat down with Yves Hanoulle at the Scrum Master Summit 2021 to discuss why Size Matters: Art of Getting Work Done with Smaller Teams.  The focus was on the trasnformation I enabled for a larger development team to achive scrum by desizing and focusing on core Agile principles.  I recounted the details in [Leveraging Small Teams to Scale Agility - a Red Hat Case Study](https://www.infoq.com/articles/leverage-small-teams-scale-agility/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=culture-methods).
