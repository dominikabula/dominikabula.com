I'm a PM Institute Certified #Agile Practitioner with a focus centered on continuous improvement, lean change management, and training for large distributed product development.
In addition to my work at Oracle NetSuite as an Agile Coach and member of the Oracle Women's Leadership organization, I write and speak on a variety of topics, especially focused on my real-world experiences applying Agile Methodology.

In the upcoming book, ["89 Hybrid Working Tips From Explorers"](https://leanpub.com/89hybridtips), I have written about Inclusive Hybrid Meetings.
The book is being finished now and is coordinated by Yves Hanoulle and is available on Lean Pub.

I believe in giving back to the community so I help organize or volunteer at conferences.
In November 2022 I am part of the organizational team for [Women in Agile Europe](https://womeninagile.eu/organizers/dominika-bula/).
At [Ace! Conference](https://aceconf.com) I designed all of the Miro Board content for the open spaces and the agenda, managed the LinkedIn Page for the conference, and created marketing materials.
Before that I hosted the open space session at [Women in Agile Open](https://twitter.com/womenagileopen?s=11&t=qyVA_olV1jlUG8SST775CQ) in November 2021.

In 2021, I sat down with Yves Hanoulle at the Scrum Master Summit 2021 to discuss why Size Matters: Art of Getting Work Done with Smaller Teams.
The focus was on the trasnformation I enabled for a larger development team to achive scrum by desizing and focusing on core Agile principles.
I recounted the details in [Leveraging Small Teams to Scale Agility - a Red Hat Case Study](https://www.infoq.com/articles/leverage-small-teams-scale-agility/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=culture-methods).
