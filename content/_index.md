I'm a Scrum Master and PM Institute Certified #Agile Practitioner.  In addition to my work at Red Hat on the Agile Practice and Continous Improvement Team, I write and speak on a variety of topics, especially focused on my real-world experiences applying Agile methodology.

Recently I sat down with Yves Hanoulle at the Scrum Master Summit 2021 to discuss why Size Matters: Art of Getting Work Done with Smaller Teams.  The focus was on the trasnformation I enabled for a larger development team to achive scrum by desizing and focusing on core Agile principles.
